RDFpro %s - https://github.com/dkmfbk/rdfpro (Public Domain software)

Builds and runs an RDF processing pipeline composed of one or more processors,
reading/writing compressed RDF data from/to FILEs or SPARQL endpoints.


USAGE: rdfpro -v | -h | [-V] CMD    show version [-v], help [-h] or perform CMD

CMD ::=
  @p args1                          builtin processor (see below)
  @p1 args1 ... @pN argsN           sequence composition
  { @p1 args1 , ... , @pN argsN }S  parallel composition, set operator S

S ::=
  a   multiset sum of @p1 .. @pn outputs, keep duplicates (fast, default)
  u   set union of @p1 .. @pn outputs
  U   multiset union of @p1 .. @pn outputs (with duplicates)
  i   set intersection of @p1 .. @pn outputs
  I   multiset intersection of @p1 .. @pn outputs (with duplicates)
  d   set difference @p1 \ (union of @p2 .. @pN)
  D   multiset difference @p1 \ (union of @p2 .. @pN) (with duplicates)
  s   symmetric set difference: quads in at least a @pi but not all of them
  S   multiset symmetric set difference
  n+  emits quads with at least n (number) occurrences (no duplicates out) 
  n-  emits quads with at most n (number) occurrences (no duplicates out)

FORMATS AND COMPRESSION:

RDF format and compression are detected based from the file extension or from a
'prefix' supplied using syntax 'prefix:filename' (e.g., '.ttl.gz.myfile')

RDF formats: rdf, rj, jsonld, nt, nq, trix, trig, tql, ttl, n3, brf, geonames
Compression schemes: gz, bz2, xz, 7z (need resp. gzip, bzip2, xz, 7za)
